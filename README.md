# Overview

As a software engineer, I'm committed to enhancing my coding skills and learning new programming languages. By tackling various projects using languages I'm less familiar with, I strengthen my coding foundation and produce tangible results to showcase my progress.

For this project, I created a console-based task manager application using Kotlin. This application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, removing, listing, and marking tasks as complete. Keeping track of tasks can be challenging, so the goal of this project was to create a simple yet effective tool for task management. I successfully developed this application, focusing on functionality and usability.

The primary motivation behind this software was to deepen my understanding of Kotlin, a language I have been keen to explore. This project also tested my coding fundamentals, offering an opportunity to delve into various language features and libraries while addressing a practical problem: effective task management.

# Development Environment

Once again, I utilized the simplicity of Visual Studio Code as my development environment, equipped with Kotlin extensions. Although I considered using IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code provided all the necessary tools and features for decent Kotlin development, including debugging support. I also benefited from extensive assistance from ChatGPT and online resources.

I developed with Kotlin version "1.5.31". From the Kotlin standard library, I used mutable lists and simple control structures. The mutable list was ideal for storing and managing tasks. I utilized basic Kotlin syntax to implement the core functionalities of the task manager. The primary focus was on creating a user-friendly console interface to perform task operations effectively.
